Materials for MAD 4401 Numerical Analysis, UF Fall 2018

Hi reader. I have some python scripts that I used for the first project to generate the bisection and Newton's method data.

Those scripts can be found in a SEPARATE REPO of mine, called "BisectionandNewtonMethods"

https://github.com/leesongithub/BisectionandNewtonMethods

I have literally no idea why I made them separate.
